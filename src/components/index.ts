/**
 * Component Library - Atomic Design Structure
 *
 * This file provides barrel exports for all components following Atomic Design principles:
 * - Atoms: Smallest building blocks (Button, Badge, Icons)
 * - Molecules: Simple combinations of atoms (Logo, NavLink, SectionHeader)
 * - Organisms: Complex UI sections (Navbar, Hero, Footer)
 * - Templates: Page layouts (MainLayout, etc.)
 */

// Atoms
export * from "./atoms";

// Molecules
export * from "./molecules";

// Organisms (will be added as we refactor)
// export * from "./organisms";

// Templates (will be added if needed)
// export * from "./templates";
